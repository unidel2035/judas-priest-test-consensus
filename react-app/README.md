# React Test Application

This is a simple React test application created to demonstrate basic React functionality.

## Features

- Counter component with increment, decrement, and reset functionality
- Dynamic list that can add new items
- State management using React hooks (useState)
- Event handling
- Component styling

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Navigate to the react-app directory
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
